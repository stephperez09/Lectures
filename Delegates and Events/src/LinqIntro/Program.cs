	 *		- a CLI library for enabling this sublanguage.
	 *		
	 *	LINQ uses the power of extension methods, delegates, and "lazy evaluation" to 
	 *	provide a ton of utility to C# programmers working with data structures.
	 *	
	 *	In this demo we will explore the CLI library for enabling LINQ via the 
	 *	flexible IEnumerable<T> class.
